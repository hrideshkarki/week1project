    We need to put the landing in index.html instead of landing.html because
    by default the index.html page will open up when you open a webpage.
    I'm not finding a way to specify that landing is the homepage because the computer
    will always look for the index file 

    Saying this here so that I don't forget we need to transfer it all over (once we are done, of course)
